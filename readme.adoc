This repository contains various PowerShell (Core) tools used through my .NET projects.

== Build-PSCorePsm1Module
Utilizing my project directory structure, this 'builds' a simple PowerShell Module (PSM1) project. The module copies source code into a build folder. Its inception comes from the idea of facilitating publication of PSM1 projects into Github Packages (previously Github Package Registry).

== Get-Version
Tool used for getting the version of some project, tool, or artifact. Currently only supports csproj files.

== Start-ProgressBarredSleep
Same as start-sleep but this function also shows a progress indicating the time remaining in the start-sleep function.
